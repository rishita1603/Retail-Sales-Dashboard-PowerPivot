# Retail-Sales-Dashboard-PowerPivot Practice
A small practice project built in Excel using Power Pivot to understand data modeling and cardinality. Used a minimal dataset with related tables to explore relationships, pivot tables, slicers, and timelines in a hands-on way.

📌 Overview
This is a practice Power Pivot project designed to understand and implement data relationships, cardinality using Excel. The dataset used is intentionally minimal (4 sheets with 3–5 rows each) to focus on learning and clarity.

📂 Dataset Details
The Excel workbook contains 4 sheets:
	
* Orders
* Products
* Customers	
* Region

🔗 Relationships & Cardinality

Orders[Product ID] → Products[Product ID]  
Orders[Customer ID] → Customers[Customer ID] 
Orders[Region ID] → Region[Region ID]

Relationships were defined in Power Pivot using the diagram view to reinforce practical understanding of cardinality.

📊 What’s Included

* Power Pivot Data Model
* Relationships Defined
* Pivot Table with Slicer
* Timeline for Date Filtering

Basic KPIs like:

* Total Sales
* Quantity Sold
* Average Discount

🎯 Objective

The goal of this small-scale project was to:

* Learn how to connect multiple related tables in Power Pivot
* Understand cardinality and relationship directions
* Practice pivot tables, slicers, and timelines in Excel
* Build confidence before moving to large-scale datasets

📝 Notes

This is a practice project; the dataset has limited rows and was manually created for learning purposes.
No Cost or Profit column was available; the focus was purely on relationships, not financial KPIs.
